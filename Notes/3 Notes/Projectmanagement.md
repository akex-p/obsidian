### Agile
- Constant pace
- Completely focused on **one task**
- Mindset
- **Reflect and Adjust** 
- Scrum best performance: 5-9 people
### Efficient vs Effective
- Effective = it works
- Efficient = it's fast
- Effectiveness before efficiency (**make it work first**)
### Waterfall
- Requirements
	- Design
		- Implementation
			- Verification
				- Maintenance
### Kanban
- Good starting point
- To-Do, Work in Progress, Done
### Scrum
- Immutable
- Same time, place, order
- Never skip
- Daily Scrum misunderstood
	- What did I do yesterday?
	- What do I do today?
	- Are there any blockers?
- Sprint Review
	- Present only **done** things
- Sprint Retrospective
	- For team and team only
	- What happens there, stays there
	- Talk open
