- No AI-tool may be used (otherwise: screenshots)
- Individual "creative workflow" is important (!)
### Essay
**Part One**

- Pick 3 departments (out of 10)
- Explain how they influence the movie
- How are those elements combined?

### An example - Psycho
- Intro is chaotic -> text flying in with grey bars, violins playing absurdly and still
- Landscape -> explains where we are... a city, shows even date and time !

- Secret relationship -> very detailed insight into the different lives of the characters (no music)
- Depicts possible future plans as well as the characters past -> dads dept, other problems
	- Relatable? -> audience is much more mature (horror movie)

- Marriage is a hot-topic, daughter of man marries as well (still no music)
- Gave lots of money, REALLY obviously -> boss is overly happy

- he is thinking in the mothers voice

- ends with the car removed from swamp
### Camera
- stationary
- only rotating, to follow characters -> mostly facial expression
- house almost always show from bellow, exact perspective
### Fragen
- First and foremost: What is the reason/motivation for making the movie?
- Secondly: What is the audience? Who is this targeted towards? To whom tries it to communicate?
- Others questions:
	- Why is the climax in the middle of the movie, not the end?
### Aftertalk
- Hitchcock wanted to shock (**Goal**)
- All characters, except Norman, not likable
- Schizophrenia as a topic, first time in movie-history
- Opposites in the movie:
	- Likable characters lie - Unlikable characters tell the truth
	- Norman is a murderer - Most likable character
	- Public place - private place (intro sequence)
	- Beginning of the movie - end of the affair
	-> Opposites in human beings (**Theme**)
- Different stories:
	- Story about money -> begins
	- Death of main character
### About the intro
- Title sequence shows theme of opposites and contrast
- Music -> calm and chaotic
- Motion Design -> Horizontal, vertical elements, elements combining and splitting
### Analysis
- Exposition - introduction, establish setting, characters, ...
	in Psycho: bedroom, titel, ...
- Audience is hungry for information and able to take in lots of it
- The story is taking place "somewhere" -> it could take place anywhere, even near us
- Intro slows down, gives information
- Lots of Mid-shot, no close-ups -> 35 Brennweite -> Complete movie with one optic
- Artificial light -> mostly on the face -> Eisschrank-Blick
- Camera-work, lighting, even the **acting** is unnatural, artificial
=> **Important Takeaway**: be consequent, craft every scene with thought and detail
### Important topics
- Brennweiten
- Midshot, Close-Closeup, ...
- Birds-Eye-View, ...
- On, Off (whats shown in the frame and what not)
### Short Cuts
- Exposition is the key -> Introduction of all characters (22)
	- Helicopters as main-glue
	- Themes are being setup -> taxi-scene
	- In every of the 9 stories conflict is established
### Festen
- Handheld camera -> seems improvised (tho dialogue is scripted)
- With all stripped down: still same techniques - background/foreground, outfits, ...
- Lots of focus on story
- Involves lots of "foreshadowing"
